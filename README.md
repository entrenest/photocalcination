***Technical Background***

Classical diffusion can be described by the diffusion coefficient in solid materials: 𝐷 = 𝐷_0_ * 𝑒^(-E_A_ / k_𝐵_ * T), where 𝐸_𝐴 is the energy of activation and 𝐷_ 0_ is the prefactor [1]. The energy of activation and ion jump are influenced only by a single mode of vibration within the system [1]. Conversely, the prefactor can be influenced by several modes of vibration within the system via the relationship 𝐷_0 ∝ 𝑎^2 * 𝑛 * ν * 𝑒^(∆𝑠_𝑚_ / 𝑘_𝐵), where 𝑎 is the lattice constant, 𝑛 is the number of nearest hopping sites, ν is the average frequency of vibration for the hopping atom, and ∆𝑠_𝑚_ is the entropy of migration.

Herein, ∆𝑠_𝑚_ is taken as a function of all the frequencies of vibration within a system. Due to the exponential influence over 𝐷_0_, the value of ∆𝑠_𝑚_ can influence the diffusion coefficient, 𝐷, by several orders of magnitude. Researchers aim to target specific phonons which contribute most to ion transitions, thereby lowering the energy required for diffusion to occur while preventing heating of the entire material. Thus is the foundation of phonon catalysis.

Recently, researchers at MIT established that as many as 87% of ion jumps within a Germanium substituted Lithium Phosphate computational model were the result of less than 10% of the vibrational modes between 8 – 20 THz [1]. Heat is a spectrum of multiple vibrational modes. By selectively heating-specific phonons which contribute most to ion diffusion, researchers are able to avoid heating the entire material during ion diffusion. This phenomena is proposed to help overcome critical challenges related to sorbent degradation over multiple cycles by reducing operational temperature necessary to achieve an economy of scale during Regeneration. Sorbent degradation over multiple cycles in lime-based sorbents is caused by attrition, sintering, pore occlusion, sulfurization, and the formation of passivation layers [6]. Operational temperatures typically exceed the Tamman temperature of Calcium Carbonate (533 °C) [9].

Once the Tamman temperature has been exceeded, vibrations cause the crystal lattice to loosen, resulting in rapid surface area reductions, pore volume shrinkage, small particle agglomeration [9]. These phenomena are noted to degrade sorbents to levels as low as 8 – 10% of the initial efficacy after 20 – 30 cycles [6], [7]. Micropores and mesopores experience surface and capillary forces with CO 2 molecules, respectively, while macropores contribute to bulk fluid dynamic flow without experiencing intermolecular forces [7]. These micropores and mesopores leverage Knudsen diffusion to limit the free mean path of Carbon Dioxide movement within a pore, thereby promoting collision and capture. Thus, sorbent kinetics are largely dependent upon substrate characteristics and functionality [7], [9]. Therefore, preservation or reliable regeneration of these characteristics and associated functionality post-calcination are primary considerations for developing the next generation of calcination and sorbent Regeneration methods.

The bond energy within a molecular vibration is not continuous, rather it is quantized. Thus, molecules only stretch and bend at certain, discrete, “allowed” frequencies of molecular oscillation (vibration) [14]. If a molecule has a vibrational frequency (eigenstate) which matches the resonant frequency of the photon, the molecule will most likely adsorb energy from the photon and jump to a higher vibrational energy state in accordance with electron selection rules, the Franck-Condon Principle, et al. This does not modify the vibrational frequency of the molecule, but rather increases the amplitude of that vibration [14].
